# ktane-solver

A JavaScript library to solve the vanilla bomb modules from [Keep Talking and Nobody Explodes](https://keeptalkinggame.com/).


## üì• Installing

`npm i ktane-solver`


## üìñ: Terms

- **Bomb** - the device which holds an amount of modules.
- **Modules** - a device which contains a single, solvable puzzle which needs to be solved by the Defuser.
- **Needy Modules** - a device which contains a single, unsolvable puzzle which needs to be regularly tended to by the Defuser.
- **Stage** - a section or part of a module, indicated by a green LED on the right side of the module.
- **Defuser** - the person that has sole access to the bomb.
- **Expert(s)** - the person/people that has/have sole access to the Bomb Defusal Manual.
- **"bomb check"** - the process of gathering information about the bomb.
- **"display number" or "display letter"** - the big number/letter at the top of some modules.




## üí£ The Bomb object

Some modules require information about the bomb in order to solve.

- `digit: int` - the last digit of the serial code.
- `vowel: boolean` - if the serial code contains a vowel.
- `car: boolean` - if the bomb has a CAR lit indicator.
- `frk: boolean` - if the bomb has a FRK lit indicator.
- `pport: boolean` - if the bomb has a parallel port.
- `batteries: int` - the amount of batteries on the bomb.



**Methods**

- `add_strike()` - Add a strike to the bomb.
- `reset_strikes` - Reset the bomb's strike count.
- `reset_memory()` - Reset the Memory module. This is called automatically after solving the Memory module. 
- `reset_sequence()` - Reset the Sequence module. This is called automatically after solving the Sequence module. 



**Example**

```js
let bomb = new Bomb(2, true, false, true, true, 1)
```
This creates a bomb instance that has:
- A serial code with a vowel, and an even number as the last digit
  - For example: `AWXYZ2`
- No CAR lit indicator
- A FRK lit indicator
- A parallel port
- 1 battery

### üêç Complicated Wires

**Input**

- `wires: Array<String>` - a String array describing the wire colour(s), if there's a star, and if the light is on.
  - Possible colours, up to 2 at once: `red`, `white`, `blue`
- `bomb: Object` an instance of the bomb object.

**Output**

- A list of Booleans describing if each wire should be cut.
  - `true` - cut the wire.
  - `false` - don't cut the wire.

**Throws**

- If a colour is unrecognised.



**Notes**

- If there's no star, you don't need to include "star" in the wire description.

- If the light isn't on, you don't need to include "light" in the wire description.

- The order of each wire description doesn't matter. i.e. `light red star`, `red star light`, and `star light red` are all equivalent and valid inputs.

- The order of each wire colour doesn't matter. i.e. `red blue` and `blue red` are the both equivalent and valid inputs.



**Example**

```js
import Bomb from "ktane-solver/bomb"
import Complicated from "ktane-solver/complicated"

let bomb = new Bomb(2, true, false, false, true, 1)

Complicated.solve(["white star", "red star", "red star", "blue star", "light blue star", "light red white star"], bomb)

>> [ true, true, true, false, false, true ]
```

### üåΩ Maze

**Input**

- `ind: Array<int>` - an int array of the position of either green indicator.
- `start: Array<int>` - an int array of the position of the white light.
- `end: Array<int>` - an int array of the position of the red triangle.

**Output**

- A list of directions that the Defuser should input into the module.
  - Possible directions: `UP`, `DOWN`, `LEFT`, `RIGHT`

**Throws**

- If the green indicator is unrecognised.



**Notes**

- Each position counts from 1.
- The position follows the following notation: across first, then down.
- Only one green indicator is required to identify the correct maze.
- This solution uses a modified version of [this maze-solving algorithm](https://stackoverflow.com/a/52146134/12865020). Thank you trincot.



**Example**

```js
import Maze from "ktane-solver/maze"

Maze.solve([3, 5], [6, 4], [1, 5])

>> ['DOWN', 'LEFT', 'UP', 'UP', 'RIGHT', 'UP', 'UP', 'LEFT', 'DOWN', 'LEFT', 'DOWN', 'DOWN', 'DOWN', 'DOWN', 'LEFT', 'LEFT', 'LEFT', 'UP'
]
```

*Based on this maze configuration:*

### üåà Wire Sequence

**Input**

- `wires: Array<String>` - a String array describing the wire colour, and the letter it routes to.
  - Possible colours: `red`, `black`, `blue`
  - Possible letters: `A`, `B`, `C`
- `bomb: Object` an instance of the bomb object.

**Output**

**Example**

```js
import Bomb from "ktane-solver/bomb"
import Sequence from "ktane-solver/sequence"

let bomb = new Bomb(2, true, false, false, true, 1)

Sequence.solve(["black a", "black b"], bomb)
Sequence.solve(["red c", "red a", "red c"], bomb)
Sequence.solve(["red a"], bomb)
Sequence.solve(["blue b", "red a", "blue b"], bomb)

>> [ true, false ]
>> [ true, false, false ]
>> [ true ]
>> [ true, false, false ]
```

  - `1` - the light is on.
  - `0` - the light is off.

**Output**

- The direction that the knob should be pointed.

**Throws**

- If a light sequence is unrecognised.



**Notes**

- The order should be left-to-right, top-to-bottom.



**Example**

```js
import Knob from "ktane-solver/knob"

Knob.solve("101100111010")

>> RIGHT
```
